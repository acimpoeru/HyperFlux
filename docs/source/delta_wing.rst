Abstract
--------

In the present study the flow field around :math:`65^\circ` delta wing is investigated using the unstructured density based solver zCFD. The simulations were carried out by solving the steady state RANS equations using the k-Ï‰ SST turbulence model at :math:'13.3^\circ' flow angle for :math: 'Re=6.0e06' (NASA) and :math:'Re=3.0e06' based on MAC. Within this analysis the numerical solutions are compared against wind tunnel results performed at NASA and DLR. 


Geometry Specification
----------------------
	
The geometry has been generated using the analytical definition available in  the reference (Chu and Luckring). For the present study two sets of simulations were performed: (1) Comparison against the experiment performed at NASA and (2) Comparison against the experiment performed at DLR as part of the VFE 2 project.
