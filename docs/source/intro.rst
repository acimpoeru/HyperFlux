Introduction
============

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used in a wide range of engineering sectors for the analysis and design of products – from aircraft to racing cars and jet turbines.  Current CFD technology is lacking in accuracy and efficiency for unsteady flow problems (including acoustics) and for resolving shed vortices and wakes.  This is a real problem for industry: expensive physical prototypes are still required since computational tools are unreliable for these unsteady flow phenomena.  
High-order methods (HOMs) provide a potential solution, providing higher fidelity solutions than currently achievable with low-order schemes on unstructured grids. Dr. Peter Vincent and his group at Imperial College are experts in this field - underpinned by an EPSRC Early Career Fellowship and DTA PhD Studentships. The group will work with technical specialists at the Centre for Modelling and Simulation (CFMS) and cloud high performance computing (HPC) specialist Zenotech to create a prototype software base for industrial evaluation.   HOMs has the potential to speed up the design cycle, reduce costs and improve products.   

Airbus, ARA, BAE Systems, Airbus Group Innovation, Rolls-Royce, DSTL, Arup, Williams F1 and the newly formed UK Aerospace Technology Institute will be non-financial partners / provide evaluation. Each of the industrial primes will contribute a test case to evaluate the prototype software – validating and verifying it against existing data and processes, and providing feedback on the impact on the need for physical prototyping.  The KTN will be directly involved to provide additional dissemination. 
CFMS will lead the integration and dissemination activities from its supercomputer facility at the Bristol and Bath Science Park.  The software prototype will embody the latest in high-performance computing, particularly heterogeneous configurations of conventional and many-core processors for speed and energy efficiency.  NVIDIA will support the project via its technical team in Bristol.  Via remote (cloud) access to its virtual engineering hub, CFMS will make the prototype software available to other sectors (civil engineering, automotive and renewable energy) and support its uptake with local specialists. 

Hyper Flux will be a shared UK-based software tool, underpinned by expertise within the UK.   This is in line with government strategies for HVM and ICT, and forms a cornerstone for the new UK aerodynamics ATI.   This will further establish a center of expertise in the application of the new models to on-ramp new users – particularly SMEs.
