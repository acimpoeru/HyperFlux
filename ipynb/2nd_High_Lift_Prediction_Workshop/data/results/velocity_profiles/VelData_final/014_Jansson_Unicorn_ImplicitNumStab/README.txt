HiLiftPW-2 data for group 014 (KTH/BCAM)

NB:

We use a goal-oriented (targeted toward cd and cl) adaptive mesh
refinement method and solver. Therefore we have used the same
configuration (Config 4 (including Slat Tracks and Flap Track
Fairings)) for both the grid convergence in case1 and the full results
in case2b, i.e. the adaptive mesh refinement method generates a
sequence of successively finer meshes and corresponding solutions,
where we use the finest mesh for case2b.

This is indicated in the TecPlot forms, where we use
"adaptive_mesh_finest" to indicate the finest mesh generated by the
adaptive mesh refinement method, and "adaptive_mesh_level_X" to
indicate the mesh corresponding to refinement level, where X=0 means
the coarsest mesh.

Note that our method is node-centered and thus "N" indicates the
number of vertices. Also note that the mesh is of the full airplane.
