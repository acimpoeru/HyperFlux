This data set is a revision of the date set submitted before HiLiftPW2
data submission deadline. Aerodynamic forces related to CL were
corrected due to a wrong post-processing to evaluate aerodynamic forces
related to CL at HiLiftPW2.

The absolute values of CL in "case1_iterative.dat" to indicate solution
convergence by iteration are different from the true values of CL due to
a wrong post-processing to evaluate CL. The other absolute values of
aerodynamic forces such as CD and CM in "case1_iterative.dat" are true.
If you can see the abrupt jump in the convergence history of CL, the
jump is due to the correction of the wrong post-processing in the
computation.
