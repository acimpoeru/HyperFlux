The absolute values of CL in "case1_iterative.dat" to indicate solution
convergence by iteration are different from the true values of CL due to
a wrong post-processing to evaluate CL. The other absolute values of
aerodynamic forces such as CD and CM in "case1_iterative.dat" are true.
If you can see the abrupt jump in the convergence history of CL, the
jump is due to the correction of the wrong post-processing in the
computation.
