I uploaded the updated data for the HiLiftPW2 performed with NSMB (ID-011). The modifications are the addition of the test case 4 (bump) for the turbulent models SA-Original and SA-Edouards, and adding the results (cases 1 and 4) performed with the SA-salsa. Each file contains all the data, even if they are identical to the previous soumission.

The unsteady results are unfortunately not yet established.





Instructions:

  - For a given code and turbulence model, create a directory with all filled-out data submittal 
    forms (with their original names) in it. If you are not using an optional file, please remove it.

  - The directory should be named: ID_Lastname_Code_Model_Otheridentifierifneeded (e.g., 
    011_Jones_CFD++_SST-V), where "Code" is the CFD code's name and "Model" is the turbulence model 
    type. The ID number will be assigned to you by the committee.

  - Tar and gzip the directory.

  - Results from a different code and/or different turbulence model need to be put into a different 
    directory. 

All CFD data should be given in deployed (un-stowed) coordinates (i.e., directly from the grids as 
computed). If participants analyzed additional alphas, they are encouraged to include them in the 
data submittal if desired.

Tecplot macro files and instructions are posted on the HiLiftPW website (http://hiliftpw.larc.nasa.gov/Workshop2/DataForm.html)
to aid in the extraction of the requested data.
